                     <h2>What Is COVID-19?</h2>
                     <p>A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. 
                         Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.

                        In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization 
                        identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.
                        
                        COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory 
                        tract infection. It can affect your upper 
                        respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs). </p>
